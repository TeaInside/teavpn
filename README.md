#  Tasks

In this lab, students need to implement a simple VPN for Linux.

- Task 1: Create a Host-to-Host Tunnel using TUN/TAP.
- Task 2: Create a Host-to-Gateway Tunnel.
- Task 3: Create a Gateway-to-Gateway Tunnel.
- Task 4: Create a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
- Task 5: Authentication and Key Exchange.
- Task 6: Supporting Multiple VPN Tunnels.

**Submission and Demonstration**

You should submit a detailed lab report to describe your design and implementation. You should also de-scribe how you test the functionalities and security of your system. You also need to demonstrate yoursystem to us. Please sign up a demonstration time slot with the TA. Please take the following into consider-ation when you prepare for demonstraiton:

1. The total time of the demo will be 15 minutes, no more additional time would be given. So prepareyour demonstration so you can cover the important features.
2. You are entirely responsible for showing the demo.  We will NOT even touch the keyboard duringthe demonstration;  so you should not depend on us to test your system.  If you fail to demo someimportant features of your system, we will assume that your system does not have those features.
3. You need to practice before you come to the demonstration.  If the system crashes or anything goeswrong, it is your own fault. We will not debug your problems, nor give you extra time for it.
4. During the demo, you should consider yourself as salesmen, and you want to sell your system to us.You are given 15 minutes to show us how good your system is.  So think about your sales strategies.If you have implemented a great system, but fail to show us how good it is, you are not likely to get agood grade.
5. Do turn off the messages your system prints out for debugging purposes. Those messages should notappear in a demonstration.
